# Starbucks-Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation for Starbucks reward program members on the basis of their reactions to offers, to further design marketing strategies accordingly 

I watched the netflix documentary __"The Social Dilemma"__ and got fascinated by how marketing strategies use Data Science in our era of Big Data.

I also read an article on how __Starbucks is like a bank__ on Groww ( yeah, me proud reader of Groww and Finshots), and found it intresting how starbucks earns lot of money through intrest earned on the money deposited. Being a curious person, I decided to investigate how starbucks convinced its customers to deposit so much money with them. That's how I discovered Starbuck's reward program. 

So, being a coffee lover and someone intrested in business mechanisms, I decided to take up this project. (My favourite is Caramel Latte, Thanks :) 


__Q Why segment customers ???__

Ans - Well, because it is still a very difficult and computationally intensive task to target each customer in unique ways, as well as there would be lots of customers on which similar Marketing strategies and Discount offers would work well. Hence it makes intutive sense to break the customer base into clusters on the basis of how and which offers they react to and then proceed to make targeted strategies.
